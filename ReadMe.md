INFO:
If you entered a ticker but it does not work, the reason being is that I currently do extensive exploratory research on company's financials which requires all my allowed API calls from my data provider.
My goal is to release a professional web app going even deeper into the datasets covering
- company's financials
- sector and industry analysis
- when to invest in which group of company's best
- what makes stock successfull on the stock market
- and several more topics.
